### This file maps internal item IDs to proper names to ensures naming consistency across all mods
### Separated from .py files to allow for easier access in the `_internal` folder of Mod Builder - Revived
### YAML over JSON here for human-readability and comment support

### Combine multiple variants/styles into a single entry and use an additional key to identify them if the mod calls for it
###   "variant" = different versions with unique names (.270 Huntsman vs .270 Stradivarios vs .270 Warden)
###      Some shared attributes (tuning files) but may have different prices or unlock requirements
###   "style" = different versions with a shared name (tents/blinds/decoys etc) and no reason to separate
### This is mostly to enable Modify Store to see all variants separately but there may be other uses
### There are edge cases where item names differ between game file and in equipment_data.bin (crossbows are a mess)

### Weapon names that end in identifier numbers like _01, _02, etc. are cosmetic variants of the same weapon
### Do not include variants as separate weapons. Return a name that can idenfiy all variants of a weapon
### Some weapons (mostly crossbows) have names that appear to be variants but are separate weapons with unique stats
### Tuning and bundle files commonly have different names. Use YAML anchors (&) and aliases (*) to avoid duplicating data
